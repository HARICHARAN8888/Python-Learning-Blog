# Simple Calculator using Tkinter

A simple Python-based GUI calculator built with Tkinter that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
This project demonstrates event-driven programming, GUI layout design, and exception handling in Python.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Interactive and user-friendly graphical interface.  
- Real-time display of inputs and results.  
- “C” button to clear the display and start a new calculation.  
- Handles invalid input safely with error messages.

## Example

Performing calculation:  
`Input: 5 + 3 * 2`  
`Output: 11`

## Code Overview

The program includes three main functions:

1. **`press(key)`**  
   Appends the pressed key (number or operator) to the current expression.

2. **`equal()`**  
   Evaluates the expression entered by the user and displays the result.

3. **`clear()`**  
   Clears the calculator display.
