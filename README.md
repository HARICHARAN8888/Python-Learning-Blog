# Count Vowels and Consonants

A simple Python program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a user-provided string.  
This project demonstrates basic string manipulation, conditional logic, and clean coding practices in Python.

## Features

- Accepts any text input from the user.
- Converts all characters to lowercase for uniform processing.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, spaces, etc.).
- Displays the count of vowels and consonants separately.

## Example

`Enter a string: Python Programming`  
`Vowels: 4`  
`Consonants: 13`



## Code Overview

The program includes two main functions:

1. **`count_vowels_consonants(text)`**:  
   Handles the logic for counting vowels and consonants.

2. **`main()`**:  
   Manages user input and prints the result.
