# User input operation Program

This is my Python script created for **Hacktoberfest 2025** under the [VGLUG Python Learning Blog](https://github.com/vglug/Python-Learning-Blog) repository.

## About
This program takes **two numbers as input** and performs basic arithmetic operations:  
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

It also handles division by zero gracefully using **exception handling**.

## How to Use
1. Open the script file in any Python IDLE or editor.
2. Run the script.
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.
4. The program will print:
   - Sum of the numbers  
   - Subtraction of the numbers  
   - Multiplication of the numbers  
   - Division of the numbers (if second number is not zero)

## Steps I Followed
1. Forked the VGLUG repository.
2. Created a new branch with the problem name as `user-input-operations`.
3. Created a folder named `user-input-operations` and added the script file inside it.
4. Committed the changes and created a Pull Request.
